# 24914-affix-productivity

Code for my Assignment 2 for 24.914 as taken in Spring 2021.

The paper responds to [Baayen and Renouf (1996)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/416794), in which the authors analyze the productivity of English affixes in issues of the London newspaper the Times from 1989-1992. They discover that between the competitor affixes -ness and -ity, -ness is more productive, and that the discrepancy in productivity actually widened over time. Using the # of recorded neologisms as an indicator of productivity, they find that -ness overall coins more neologisms than -ity, and that by the end of the sample period -ness had become more productive.

This result struck me as unintuitive, especially given the short timespan, so I sought to investigate the same phenomenon with a different corpus: namely, the [Corpus of Historical American English (COHA)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/8SRSYK).
